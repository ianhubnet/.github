### 👋 Welcome to Ianhub

**Ianhub** is a private software company founded by [Kader Bouyakoub (bkader)](https://github.com/bkader), dedicated to crafting high-performance, developer-centric web solutions in PHP.

We specialize in creating **lightweight, modular, and secure application frameworks** designed for developers who value **speed, structure, and flexibility**.

### 🚀 CodeIgniter Skeleton (CSK)

**CodeIgniter Skeleton (CSK)** is Ianhub’s flagship framework — a private, modular application foundation built on [CodeIgniter 3](https://github.com/bcit-ci/codeigniter). It serves as the core engine powering several internal and commercial projects.

🧩 **Core Highlights**
- Modular architecture with built-in admin interface.
- Theme and marketplace integration.
- Advanced authentication system (with optional 2FA).
- Minimalist database design built for scalability.
- Optimized for performance and maintainability.

> CSK is not open source. Access is restricted to Ianhub’s internal projects and selected partners.

### 💡 Our Vision

We believe the web should be **faster, cleaner, and developer-first**.

At Ianhub, every line of code follows three guiding principles:
- **Clarity** — Code should be readable and logical.
- **Consistency** — Structure breeds scalability.
- **Control** — Developers deserve full ownership of their stack.
